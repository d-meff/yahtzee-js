Welcome to my Yahtzee Project! 

If you would like to play the game, here's the <a href="https://dannythekid1292.github.io/yahtzee-js/">link to the game</a>.

If you do not know the rules of Yahtzee, a helpful resource has been linked <a href="https://gamerules.com/rules/yahtzee-dice-game/">here</a>.

<h2><strong>Technologies Used</strong></h2>
<ul>
  <li>HTML</li>
  <li>CSS</li>
  <li>JavaScript</li>
  <li>jQuery</li>
 </ul>

<h2>Notes</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Please hold all dice before submitting a score.</li>
<li>Known "Issue": Doesn't really effect gameplay but after you submit all of your options, you technically get one more turn. However, you can't submit any options to gain points so it's better to just Reset the Game beforehand if you would like to play again.</li>
<li>I did not include the feature of getting an 100 point bonus for each extra Yahtzee after the first one was submitted.</li>
</ul>
